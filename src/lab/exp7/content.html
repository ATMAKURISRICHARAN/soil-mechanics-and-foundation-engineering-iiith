            To determine the relationships between moisture contents and soil densities under a standard method of compaction and also the effects of these moisture contents on the ability of the soil to resist penetration. Two types of compaction tests are routinely performed: (1) The Standard Proctor Test, and (2) The Modified Proctor Test. <br> <br>
The Proctor compaction test is a laboratory method of experimentally determining the optimal moisture content at which a given soil type will become most dense and achieve its maximum dry density. The term Proctor is in honor of R. R. Proctor, who in 1933 showed that the dry density of a soil for a given compactive effort depends on the amount of water the soil contains during soil compaction. His original test is most commonly referred to as the standard Proctor compaction test; later on, his test was updated to create the modified Proctor compaction test.<br><br>
These laboratory tests generally consist of compacting soil at known moisture content into a cylindrical mould of standard dimensions using a compactive effort of controlled magnitude. The soil is usually compacted into the mould to a certain amount of equal layers, each receiving a number blows from a standard weighted hammer at a specified height. This process is then repeated for various moisture contents and the dry densities are determined for each. The graphical relationship of the dry density to moisture content is then plotted to establish the compaction curve. The maximum dry density is finally obtained from the peak point of the compaction curve and its corresponding moisture content, also known as the optimal moisture content.

          Compaction is the process of densification of soil mass by reducing air voids. The purpose of laboratory compaction test is so determine the proper amount of water at which the weight of the soil grains in a unit volume of the compacted is maximum, the amount of water is thus called the Optimum Moisture Content (OMC). In the laboratory different values of moisture contents and the resulting dry densities, obtained after compaction are plotted both to arithmetic scale, the former as abscissa and the latter as ordinate. The points thus obtained are joined together as a curve. The maximum dry density and the corresponding OMC are read from the curve.

	      Procedure for the experiment is as follows.
	    </p>
 <p align="justify">
i. Take about 20 kg of soil and sieve it through 20 mm and 4.75 mm.<br>
ii. A 100 mm diameter Proctor mould is to be used if the soil fraction that passes 4.75 mm sieve is greater than 80% by weight.<br>
iii. Take about 2.25 kg of the soil sample and add water to get the moisture content round 8%. Leave the mix to mature for few minutes.<br>
iv. Clean and grease gently the inside surface of the mould, and the base plate.<br>
v. Take the weight of empty mould with the base plate.<br>
vi. Fir the collar and place the mould on a solid base.<br>
vii. Place first batch of soil inside the mould and apply 25 blows of Standard rammer, so that the compacted layer thickness is about one-third height of the mould Scratch the top of the compacted soil before the second layer is placed Place the second batch of wet soil and follow the same procedure In all the soil is compacted in three layers, each given 25 blows of the standard rammer weighing 2.6 Kg and having a drop of 310 mm.<br>
viii. Remove the collar, and trim of the excess soil with trimming knife. Clean the mould, and weight the mould with the compacted soil and the base plate.<br>
ix. Take a representative sample from the mould and determine its water content.<br>
x. Repeat the above procedure for water content values of 13%, 17%, 20%, 22% and 25%.
