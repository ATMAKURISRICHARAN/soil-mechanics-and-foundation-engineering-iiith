            To determine the relationships between moisture contents and soil densities under a standard method of compaction and also the effects of these moisture contents on the ability of the soil to resist penetration. Two types of compaction tests are routinely performed: (1) The Standard Proctor Test, and (2) The Modified Proctor Test. Each of these tests can be performed in three different methods as outlined in the attached Table 1. In the Standard Proctor Test, the soil is compacted by a 5.5 lb hammer falling a distance of one foot into a soil filled mold. The mold is filled with three equal layers of soil, and each layer is subjected to 25 drops of the hammer. The Modified Proctor Test is identical to the Standard Proctor Test except it employs, A 10 lb hammer falling a distance of 18 inches, and uses five equal layers of soil instead of three. There are two types of compaction molds used for testing: The smaller type is 4 inches in diameter and has a volume of about 1/30 ft3 (944 cm3) and the larger type is 6 inches in diameter and has a volume of about 1/13.333 ft3 (2123 cm3). If the larger mold is used each soil layer must receive 56 blowsinstead of 25 (See Table 1).

          Compaction is the process of densification of soil mass by reducing air voids. The purpose of laboratory compaction test is so determine the proper amount of water at which the weight of the soil grains in a unit volume of the compacted is maximum, the amount of water is thus called the Optimum Moisture Content (OMC). In the laboratory different values of moisture contents and the resulting dry densities, obtained after compaction are plotted both to arithmetic scale, the former as abscissa and the latter as ordinate. The points thus obtained are joined together as a curve. The maximum dry density and the corresponding OMC are read from the curve.
